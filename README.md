# ***The Influence of Taxes on State Migration***


## **I.	Intro**

  US states govern themselves on a number of issues such as tax rates. We wanted to know, _to what extent do state tax rates have an impact on inter-state migration_? For example, is there a relationship between a state having relatively high tax rates and people leaving the state?

An event dubbed “[The Great California Exodus](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/journal-editorial-report/wsj-opinion-the-great-migration-out-of-california/AD5A0538-8173-450D-8893-93C5B02580DD)” piqued our interest because it describes the hundreds of thousands of Californians leaving the state each year. One of the reasons cited for leaving the state is high taxes. So which tax rates account for the majority of state revenue?

By far, state income and sales tax rates account for most of the state’s revenue. A third category we considered was property tax, but property tax was mostly a source of revenue for local governments (ie: counties) rather than state governments. We are going to use historical income and sales tax data from the last 15 years to predict the state migration patterns going into and out of states.
